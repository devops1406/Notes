Linux Directory Structure
    ROOT(/)
        boot/
        etc/
        bin/
        var/
        tmp/
        home/
	
ROOT(/) : The root directory is the directory on Unix-like operating systems that contains all other directories and files on the system and which is designated by a forward slash ( / ). Root directory typically include /bin, /boot, /dev, /etc, /home, /initrd, /lib, /lost+found, /misc, /mnt, /opt, /proc, /root, /sbin, /tmp, /usr and /var

boot/ : This directory contains everything required for the boot process except for configuration files not needed at boot time and the map installer. Thus, the /boot directory stores data that is used before the kernel begins executing user-mode programs. This may include redundant (back-up) master boot records, sector/system map files, the kernel and other important boot files and data that is not directly edited by hand. Programs necessary to arrange for the boot loader to be able to boot a file are placed in /sbin. Configuration files for boot loaders are placed in /etc.

/etc - Usually contain the configuration files for all the programs that run on your Linux/Unix system.

/bin - Contains the executable (i.e., ready to run) programs that must be available in order to attain minimal functionality for the purposes of booting (i.e., starting) and repairing a system. Among the contents of /bin are the shells (e.g., bash and csh), ls, grep, tar, kill, echo, ps, cp, mv, rm, cat, gzip, ping, su and the vi text editor. These programs can be used by both the root user (i.e., the administrative user) and ordinary users.

/var - Contains files to which the system writes data during the course of its operation. Contains variable data like system logging files, mail and printer spool directories, and transient and temporary files. Some portions of /var are not shareable between different systems. For instance, /var/log, /var/lock, and /var/run. Other portions may be shared, notably /var/mail, /var/cache/man, /var/cache/fonts, and /var/spool/news.
